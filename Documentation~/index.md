# XRC Core

## Overview
Provide a brief, high-level explanation of the package.

## Package contents	
Include the location of important files you want the user to know about. For example, if this is a sample package containing textures, models, and materials separated by sample group, you might want to provide the folder location of each group.

## Installation instructions
You can point to the official Package Manager installation instructions, but if you have any special installation requirements, such as installing samples, add them here.

## Requirements	
This is a good place to add hardware or software requirements, including which versions of the Unity Editor this package is compatible with.

## Limitations	
If your package has any known limitations, you can list them here. If not, or if the limitations are trivial, exclude this section.

## Workflows	
Include a list of steps that the user can easily follow that demonstrates how to use the feature. You can include screenshots to help describe how to use the feature.

## Advanced topics
This is where you can provide detailed information about what you are providing to users. This is ideal if you donâ€™t want to overwhelm the user with too much information up front.

## Reference
If you have a user interface with a lot of properties, you can provide the details in a reference section. Using tables is a good way to provide quick access to specific property descriptions.

## Samples
For packages that include sample files, you can include detailed information on how the user can use these sample files in their projects and scenes.

## Tutorials
If you want to provide walkthroughs for complicated procedures, you can also add them here. Use step-by-step instructions and include images if they can help the user understand.
