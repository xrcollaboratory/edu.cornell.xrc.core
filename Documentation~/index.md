This sample offers a range of materials, models, prefabs, scenes, and other assets that are not shipped with the runtime package scripts. These assets provide a starting point for building virtual environments, saving developers time and effort during the initial setup process.

#### PlayArea

This prefab can be used as a standardized scene environment across different projects. See sample scene for usage example.

#### PoseMarker

This prefab can be used to indicate a pose of an object by placing it as a child of the object. See sample scene for usage example.
